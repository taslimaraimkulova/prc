- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) - For Fonts
- [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces)-For Fonts

### What I learned

This is our first one-page site to house all of our content.
Such a site is also called a landing page.
This is a site, all the content of which is placed on one page, which is viewed by scrolling.
It was very interesting to style it and look at the result.
We also learned how to use icons for the title of the page.
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png"> 
```
We first encountered the "transitions" attribute in css
it is a cascading style sheet module that allows animating elements of an HTML document using CSS
```css
footer > ul > li > a img{
    transition: .25s;
}
```
We started using filters and their values ​​in css
```css
filter: invert(1) brightness(0);
```

There was nothing new in the java script for us

### Continued development

Most of the work involved CSS and HTML. JavaScript was also involved, but not as much as we would like.
In the course of our work, we discovered a lot about CSS.
We realized that we still have a lot to learn about CSS, which is why, in the future, we plan to get better at CSS and JavaScript.


### Useful resources
- For the icons, we followed the links to the sources from the "style-guide" file:
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io)
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com)

- For the font, we used links to(Again, all of these links were in the "style-guide"):
- Family: [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow)
- Weights: 600
- Family: [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces)
- Weights: 700, 900
